                    dog, (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the gray
                    wolf (Canis lupus) and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular
                    domestic animals in the world (the cat is the other). For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a hunting
                    companion, protector, object of scorn or adoration, and friend.
                    
                    The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating
                    dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic engineering, dogs were bred to
                    accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the evolution
                    of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts
                    and created new breeds as need or desire arose.
                    
                    The sizes of dogs
                    The sizes of dogsDogs vary significantly in size. Chihuahuas, the smallest recognized dog breed, can be 5 to 8 inches
                    (about 13 to 20 cm) tall at the shoulder, while the Irish Wolfhound, the tallest dog breed, can be 30 inches (76 cm) or
                    more.
                    Dogs are regarded differently in different parts of the world. Characteristics of loyalty, friendship, protectiveness,
                    and affection have earned dogs an important position in Western society, and in the United States and Europe the care
                    and feeding of dogs has become a multibillion-dollar business. Western civilization has given the relationship between
                    human and dog great importance, but, in some of the developing nations and in many areas of Asia, dogs are not held in
                    the same esteem. In some areas of the world, dogs are used as guards or beasts of burden or even for food, whereas in
                    the United States and Europe dogs are protected and admired. In ancient Egypt during the days of the pharaohs, dogs were
                    considered to be sacred.
